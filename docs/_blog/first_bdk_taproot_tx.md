This is the first of a two-parts blog series in which I will try to explain all the changes that I made to BDK (and some of its dependencies) to make our [first Taproot transaction in mainnet][first-mainnet-tx], which also
turned out to be [the first ever use of the new `OP_CHECKSIGADD` opcode][first-ever-use-checksigadd].

Hopefully this will give an insight into what kind of changes need to be made to a wallet in order to support spending `P2TR` outputs, both with key-spend and script-spend. BDK actually delegates
most of the hard work to [rust-miniscript], and luckily most of the Taproot code was already implemented by the time I started working on it. I only had to patch a few little bugs here and there, and it ended up
working flawlessly in the end.

In this first part I will focus on the changes made to our dependencies, [rust-bitcoin] and [rust-miniscript]. In the second part I will talk about BDK itself.

## Backstory

On the evening of Thursday, November 11th I was attending our weekly [Satoshi Spritz] meetup in Milan. The activation of Taproot was right around the corner, and naturally that was the main discussion
topic that night. The activation was forecasted for the early afternoon of Sunday, November 14th, a little less than 72h later.

I began to wonder how hard it would be to patch BDK and add support for Taproot. I knew most of the work had already been done in our main dependencies, [rust-bitcoin] and [rust-miniscript], and so I decided
to challenge myself: could I make it in time for the activation?

The following day I started digging into the topic. It didn't help that up until that time I only had a rather "high level" idea of how Taproot worked, but luckily all the BIPs were very well written and
straightforward to understand.

By Friday night (or rather, early Saturday morning) [I had Taproot key-spend working][first-key-spend], which made me pretty optimistic even though the activation date was actually moving closer, now being forecasted for
Sunday *morning*.

After a few hours of sleep I went back to work and by early Saturday afternoon [I had Taproot script-spend working as well][first-script-spend]. This left me a few hours to coordinate with some friends and [generate a vanity address][vanity-addr]
to deposit funds into temporarily, as we didn't trust sending them to Taproot addresses before the activation (as they were anyone-can-spend according to the pre-activation rules).

After another pretty short night, I woke up a 5:30 AM on Sunday to monitor the activation. I broadcasted our transactions shortly after 6:00 AM as the activation block was being mined. Unfortunately, the first
three blocks that were enforcing Taproot rules [didn't include any Taproot transaction][no-taproot-transactions-blocks], which indicates that the miners weren't actually running the new Bitcoin Core 22.0 nodes. The fourth block, mined by `Foundry
USA` [included my transaction][my-taproot-transaction] and [a few others][few-other-transactions].

In the end our transaction was the third Taproot script-spend in the block, but the first to use the new [`OP_CHECKSIGADD`] opcode, as the two preceding it were respectively [a single-sig][taproot-single-sig] and [a 2-of-2 multisig][taproot-bitgo-multisig]
script, made with with two `OP_CHECKSIG(VERIFY)`s.

Now, with the context out of the way, we can begin talking about the code!

## rust-bitcoin

The first dependency I had to update was [rust-bitcoin]. Most of the taproot stuff were already merged in `master` (altough they hadn't been released yet). One notable missing part was the support for [`BIP371`],
which is an extension of [`BIP174`], aka the `Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction` BIP. This new BIP defines a few new fields that are required to properly handle Taproot transactions.

Luckily most of the work had already been done by [sanket1729], so I forked his branch and made only few very minor changes, just to expose a structure that I will have to use later which in his code wasn't public.

You can find all the commits mentioned here in [my rust-bitcoin `taproot-testing` branch][rust-bitcoin-taproot-testing].

There isn't much to explain here: I disabled the `missing_docs` lint so that the compiler wouldn't complain about the new public methods that aren't documented.
Then, I added a getter for the `hash` field of `NodeInfo` and made the struct itself and a bunch of methods public.

We will use this structure later to recover the merkle root of a Taproot script tree, given one leaf and the other "hidden" branches.

## rust-miniscript

Moving on to [rust-miniscript]: once again, most of the work required to support Taproot had already been done, but this time I was working with very "early" prototype-like code, so I was prepared to
make some changes to the code to get it to work how I wanted.

Instead of showing one big diff I will talk about the commits individually, which I think will help making more clear what I was doing.

Once again, you can find all the commits referenced here in [my rust-miniscript `taproot` branch][rust-miniscript-taproot].

`TapTreeIterator` is an iterator that goes through a `TapTree` and yields a `(depth, node)` pair. This is then fed to [`TaprootBuilder`][taproot-builder-iter], which returns an error if trying to insert nodes
in [an order that is not DFS][order-that-is-not-dfs].

The way the depth was computed before made the builder always fail for non-trivial trees (i.e. more than 1 node).

Here I decided to play the safe card, and just keep track of the depth explicitly: I think there might be a way to compute the depth just knowing the `self.stack.len()` (assuming the tree has a specific structure,
which I'm not sure applies here), but anyway I didn't have much time to think about it and I just went for the "dumb but idiot-proof" way which ended up working fine.

This, I'm not really sure of: Taproot uses x-only public keys, which means that the first byte (which is usually a `03` or a `02`) that indicates the parity of the EC point is completely dropped, and it's implicit
that the point is even (= `02`). Check out [`BIP340`] for a much better explanation.

So here when I find a string that is only 64 characters long I will assume it's an x-only pubkey, and I will parse it as a normal `bitcoin::PublicKey` by prefixing it with `02`.

I guess one alternative could have been to try and parse it as a `schnorr::PublicKey` and then "convert" it to a `ecdsa::PublicKey` which should be supported, but once again I just wanted to get it done quickly and
this worked fine.

I also disabled the `unused_imports` and `missing_docs` lint so that the compiler wouldn't whine too much.

When trying to parse a descriptor (essentially turning a recursive string of `operator(args)` into an abstract tree in memory) use a *curly-bracket-aware* parser if there is one in the string.

The code to then build a `Tr` struct given an `expression::Tree` (and the `from_slice_helper_curly` function) were already implemented, so it was just a matter of correctly
building the abstract tree by parsing curly brackets in descriptors.

```

This is where things get more interesting: this section of code builds the witness to satisfy a Taproot descriptor. In case of a script-spend, we need to prove that the script we are using had been committed
into the public key of our `P2TR` input. We do this by adding a "control block", that contains data about the parity of the key, the leaf version used, and the merkle path from the leaf we are using to spend
up to the merkle root, which is committed into the public key. Once again, this is explained very well in [`BIP341`].

Before my patch the code was only getting the set of merkle paths that could lead from the root to the leaves that contain a given script. For context, the signature of `TaprootSpendInfo::as_script_map(&self)` is:

```rust
/// Access the internal script map
pub fn as_script_map(&self) -> &BTreeMap<(Script, LeafVersion), BTreeSet<TaprootMerkleBranch>> {}
```

Then the code would look for the "shortest" path to that specific script, as it would save size in the final transaction (leaves that are more "deep" in the tree than others naturally have more hidden branches
in their path to the root, and thus require a longer control block to reveal them all).

The issue here is that the `control_block` variable is then serialized directly into the witness. But this is not a control block, it's just a set of merkle paths! A control block only has *one* merkle path, and
includes the leaf version and the key parity bit.

Conveniently, the `TaprootSpendInfo` struct also has this other method (I'm including the implementation as well, because it shows that internally it does the same "trick" to find the shortest path):

```rust
/// Obtain a [`ControlBlock`] for particular script with the given version.
/// Returns [`None`] if the script is not contained in the [`TaprootSpendInfo`]
/// If there are multiple ControlBlocks possible, this returns the shortest one.
pub fn control_block(&self, script_ver: &(Script, LeafVersion)) -> Option<ControlBlock> {
    let merkle_branch_set = self.script_map.get(script_ver)?;
    // Choose the smallest one amongst the multiple script maps
    let smallest = merkle_branch_set
        .iter()
        .min_by(|x, y| x.0.len().cmp(&y.0.len()))
        .expect("Non-empty iterator");
    Some(ControlBlock {
        internal_key: self.internal_key,
        output_key_parity: self.output_key_parity,
        leaf_version: LeafVersion::default(),
        merkle_branch: smallest.clone(),
    })
}
```

So to fix this code we just have to use that method instead, and we can get it done in one single line!

Instead of removing the old code at the time I only commented it out, because I initially thought I would still have to look for the shortest script myself, and I figured the "sorting" code would come in handy
later on.

Also, if you are an acute observer, you might have noticed that there's a bug in this last snippet of code. Feel free to think about it a little bit, then check out the [PR][fix-control-block-bug-pr] I made
if you wanna know the answer!

             let max_sat_elems = match ms.max_satisfaction_witness_elements() {
```

This is a little bug in the code that tries to compute what the maximum satisfaction weight would be for a descriptor. For instance, we use this in BDK to compute how many extra sats of fees we need to pay
in order to target a given fee rate, assuming the descriptor is satisfied with the worst (larger and most expensive) path.

For Taproot descriptors, it's just a matter of iterating over the leaves in the tree and pick the most expensive one... or is it? This doesn't take into account that Taproot outputs can also be spent with
key-spend, which means just pushing a signature to the witness. This signature is 64 bytes long when using the new [`SIGHASH_DEFAULT`][`BIP341`] sighash, or 65 otherwise. Since we are thinking about the maximum satisfaction
weight, or the worst case possible, we naturally pick the latter.

Note that theoretically you could build a Taproot address "without" an available key-path spend (by using an unspendable Schnorr public key), but the code here in rust-miniscript doesn't take that into
account, as there's no way that I'm aware of to specificy in a `tr()` descriptor that the key is unspendable. So, while theoretically here we should first check whether the key-spend path is available before
accounting for its weight, in practice this is always true in miniscript so we just use that as our starting worst case and update it later if necessary while iterating the tree leaves.

This commit implements the Taproot-specific `Satisfier` methods on `PsbtInputSatisfier`. The code to produce a valid witness (i.e. *satisfy*) a descriptor by looking for Taproot key-spend or script-spend signatures
is already implemented, so it's just a matter of actually returning those, if they are present in a PSBT.

Taproot descriptors add a new miniscript operator called `multi_a()` which behaves like `multi()` in non-Taproot descriptors, but uses the new [`OP_CHECKSIGADD`] opcode when serialized in a script.

When this was added, somebody forgot to update the various methods that iterate over the public keys of a descriptor to correctly return the keys contained in `multi_a()` - essentially, it was falling back in
the default case used by the operators that don't contain any key, but this one does!

```

And finally, the last little fix: the `multi_a()` operator is satisfied by pushing to the witness either a signature (if you have one available for that specific public key) or an empty vector. The problem is,
they have to be in the right order to match the order of public keys in your Taproot script.

rust-miniscript was pushing them in reverse order, so script validation was always failing for multisigs that had more than 1 key. Adding a `.rev()` to the iterator fixed the issue.

## Conclusion

And that was it! We now have a fully working [rust-bitcoin] and [rust-miniscript] ready for Taproot.

In [Part 2] I will go over the code changes in BDK, but I think it's now time for you and I to take a break :)
